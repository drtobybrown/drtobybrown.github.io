## Astrophysics

<i>How do galaxies evolve?</i> is the question at the heart of my research. In search of answers, I examine the relationships between atomic and molecular hydrogen gas, and stellar properties of galaxies along with the internal and external processes that regulate their star formation cycle. My specialism lies in the simultaneous analysis of large, multi-wavelength datasets in order to understand the galaxy population as a whole. 

To complete this work, much of my time is spent developing and optimising bespoke software for handling, visualising and analysing big data.

Here are (relatively) up-to-date copies of my <a href="../docs/thbrownCV_academic.pdf" target="_blank">academic</a> and <a href="../docs/thbrownCV_industry.pdf" target="_blank">industry</a> CVs.
