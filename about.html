## Astrophysics

<i>How do galaxies evolve?</i> is the question at the heart of my research. In search of answers, I examine the relationships between the gas in galaxies - as the fuel for forming new stars - and their stellar, star formation, and chemical properties. My specialism lies in the analysis of large multi-wavelength datasets in order to understand galaxy populations as a whole.

I lead the Virgo Environment Traced in CO survey (VERTICO), an ongoing ALMA Large Program that is investigating the effect of extreme environments on galaxies by mapping the star-forming molecular gas in 51 galaxies in our nearest galaxy cluster, Virgo. VERTICO is the first ever Canadian-led ALMA Large Program and our team is made up of world-class researchers from all over the world who are working to reveal the physical mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution in dense environments in brilliant detail.

If you are interested, I wrote about VERTICO for <a href="https://theconversation.com/something-is-killing-galaxies-and-scientists-are-on-the-case-123236" target="_blank">The Conversation</a>.

I'm also the PI of <a href="https://github.com/opencadc/arcade" target="_blank">ARCADE</a>, an ALMA Development Study that is developing a state-of-the-art cloud computing platform for processing and analysing ALMA telescope data.
