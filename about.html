## Astrophysics

<i>How do galaxies evolve?</i> is the question at the heart of my research. In search of answers, I examine the relationships between atomic and molecular hydrogen gas, and stellar properties of galaxies along with the internal and external processes that regulate their star formation cycle. My specialism lies in the simultaneous analysis of large, multi-wavelength datasets in order to understand the galaxy population as a whole. 

As part of this work, I am the P.I. of the Virgo Environment Traced in CO (VERTICO) survey that will map the star-forming molecular gas in 53 Virgo Cluster galaxies using almost 200 hours of time on the <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/" target="_blank"> Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)</a>. The VERTICO collaboration contains world-class researchers from all over the globe and is the first Canadian-led ALMA Large Program.
