## Science Communication

I'm also a passionate science communicator and outreach enthusiast. When Iâ€™m not peering at the Universe I spend my time talking about it through radio, writing and award-winning public talks!

The Virgo Environment Traced in Carbon Monoxide survey (VERTICO), is investigating in brilliant detail how galaxies are killed by their environment.</small>
